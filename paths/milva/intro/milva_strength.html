<body class="milva_bg">

    <div class="strength_1">
        "It's time someone finally <i>told you the truth to your face.</i>
    </div>
    <div class="strength_2">
        Fuck me with a mangy rabbit if I've ever seen a stupider man!"
    </div>
    <div class="strength_3">
        Milva, who had been staring at the sky with a blank expression all along, looked down at the peasant, and her features hardened dangerously.
        <br><br>
        "Talking to me, yokel?"
        <br><br>
        "What do you think?"
        <br><br>
        Milva wiped her sweaty neck and gritted her teeth.
        <br><br><br><br>
        "This requires a bold and strong blade. A maid's place is in the kitchen, bustling around the stove... Although a wench may come in handy, she must be pure and untouched by a man. So you're not much use for anything."
        <br><br><br><br>
        The young man leaned back, tripped over his own feet and fell with an audible crack, striking the back of his head against a boulder.
        <br><br><br><br>
        the archer said, in a voice trembling with fury, rubbing her fist. "Who's the blade now, and whose place is in the kitchen? Truly, there is nothing like a fist-fight, which clears everything up. The bold and strong one is still on his feet, and the pussy and the milksop is lying on the ground."
    </div>
    <div class="strength_4">
        Milva took a step forward and swiftly threw her right fist.
    </div>
    <div class="strength_5">
        "Now you see what <i>use</i> I am,"
    </div>
    <div class="strength_6">
        The look in her tired eyes became that of a wolf.
    </div>
    <div class="strength_7">
        "You aren't a white-haired misfit from hell. And you, Dandelion, aren't a gobbling turkey.<br><br>
        <span class="strength_emph">And you, Auntie Maria, aren't a <i>slapper with a bow.</i></span>
        <br><br>
        You're Auntie Maria and I like you. I've picked the prettiest flowers for you."
    </div>
    <div class="strength_8">
        "Thank you," Milva said in a sad voice.
    </div>
