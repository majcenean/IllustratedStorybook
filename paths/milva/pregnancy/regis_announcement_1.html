        “I’m addressing all of you,” Regis said. “We are, after all, a fellowship and bear collective responsibility. The fact that the one who bears ultimate responsibility… direct responsibility, so to speak… is not with us doesn’t change anything.”
        <br><br>
        “Spit it out,” Dandelion said, irritated. “Fellowship, responsibility… What’s the matter with Milva? What’s she suffering from?”
        <br><br>
        “She’s not suffering from anything,” Cahir said softly.
    </div>
    <div class="announcement_2">
        “At least not strictly speaking,” Regis added.
        <br><br>
        “Milva’s pregnant.”
    </div>
    <div class="announcement_3">
        Cahir nodded to show it was as he suspected. Dandelion, however, was dumbstruck. Geralt bit his lip.
        <br><br>
        “How far gone is she?”
        <br><br>
        “She declined, quite rudely, to give any dates at all, including the date of her last period. But I’m something of an expert. The tenth week.”
        <br><br>
        “She’s with us now. We have suddenly been promoted to the role of husbands and fathers. So let’s listen carefully to what the physician says.”
    </div>
    <div class="announcement_4">
        “Wholesome, regular meals,” Regis began to list. “No stress. Sufficient sleep. And soon the end of horseback riding.”
        <br><br>
        They were all quiet for a long time.
    </div>
    <div class="announcement_5">
        “We hear you, Regis,” Dandelion finally said.<br><br> “My fellow husbands and fathers, we have a problem.”
