        “The archer swiftly regained her physical fitness, which could not be said for her mental state.
        <br><br>
        It often happened that she would not utter a word throughout the whole day, from dawn to dusk. She would disappear and remain isolated, which worried everyone somewhat.
        <br><br>
        Until finally a crisis occured.
    </div>
    <div class="miscarriage_6">
        Milva released the tension like a dryad or a she-elf: violently, impulsively, and not very comprehensively.
        <br><br>
        One morning, in front of our eyes, she drew a knife and without a word cut off her plait just above her shoulders. 
    </div>
     <div class="miscarriage_7">
        “It doesn’t befit me, for I’m not a maiden,” she said, seeing our jaws hanging open.
         <br><br>
         “But nor am I a widow,” she added, “so that’s the end of my mourning.”
         <br><br>
         <br><br>
         From that moment on she was her old self; brusque, biting, mouthy and inclined to use unparliamentary language.
         <br><br>From which we happily concluded that she had come through the crisis.”
