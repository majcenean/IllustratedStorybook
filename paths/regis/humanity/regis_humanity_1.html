            Regis, who was dealing with he burns on the girl's arm, interrupted their conversation.
            <br><br>
            "The dressing must be changed daily," he said. "Iâ€™ll leave you with the ointment and some gauze which won't stick to the burns."
            <br><br>
            "Thank you, barber-surgeon."
            <br><br>
            "Her arm will heal," the vampire said quietly, looking at the witcher. "With time the scar will even vanish from her young skin. What's happening in the poor girl's head is worse, though. My ointments can't cure that."
            <br><br>
            Geralt said nothing. Regis wiped his hands on a rag.

            "It's a curse," he said in hushed tones.
            <br><br>
            "To be able to sense a sickness - the entire essence of it - in the blood, but not be able to treat it..."
