            "More than that, the nature of the goal demands that you accomplish it alone, in person.
        </div>
        <br>
        The risks, dangers, hardships and constant struggle with doubt must only burden you.
        <br><br>
        <div class="regis_advice_1a">
            For, after all, they are components of the penance, the expiation of guilt you want to earn.

        <div style="font-size: 15px">
            A baptism of fire, I'd say. You'll pass through fire, which burns, but also purges.

                And you'll do it alone.
            </span>
            <br><br>
            For were someone else to <i>support you</i> in this, help you, take on even a scrap of that baptism of fire, that pain, that penance, they would, by the same token, <i>impoverish</i> you.

        <div style="font-size: 15px">
            They would deprive you of the expiation you you desire, which would be owed to them for their involvement.
        </div>
        <br>
        After all, it should be your exclusive expiation. Only you have a debt to pay off, and you don't want to run up debts with other creditors at the same time.
        <br><br>
        Is my logic correct?"

            A sense of guilt, as well as the need for expiation, for a cleansing baptism of fire, aren't things you can claim an exclusive right to.

            Life differs from banking, because it has debts which are paid off by running up debts with others."
