        The Witcher cursed under his breath. <br><br>
        He did not understand why Ciri had fled there.
        <br><br>
        He had seen her horse fall as he rushed after her along the tops of the walls. He saw her leap nimbly to her feet, but instead of running along the winding road encircling the peak, she had suddenly rushed uphill, towards the solitary tower.
        <br><br>
        <span style="font-size: 30px">
        He intended to follow Ciri up the steps when he heard a sound. From above. He quickly turned around.
        </span>

    <div class="coup_5">
        The staff fell with enough force to break his forearm. The pain utterly blinded him.
        <br><br>
        Now Geralt could see nothing and hear nothing.
        <br><br>
        He was sinking, submerging into something warm.
        <br><br>He thought his opponent had gone. He was astonished, then, when a fierce blow from the iron staff struck his thigh, smashing the shaft of his femur.
        <br><br>
        <i>If anything occurred after that, he did not remember it.</i>
