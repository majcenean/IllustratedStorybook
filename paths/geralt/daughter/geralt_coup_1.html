        “Run, Ciri, run. They’re close. I’ll stop them, you run. Fast as you can! Just like you are used to from training!”

        A massacre was played out before Cahir’s eyes, wide with terror.
        <br><br>
        The fair-haired girl, who had wounded him a moment earlier, had been fast, had been unbelievably lithe, had been like a mother cat defending her kittens.
        <br><br>
        But the white-haired fiend who had fallen amongst the men was like a tiger.
        <div class="coup_3">
        The fair-haired maid of Cintra seemed insane.
        <br><br>The white-haired fiend was not insane. He was calm and cold.
        <br><br>And killed calmly and coldly.
