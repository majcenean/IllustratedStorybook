            "By the gods, Geralt." Dandelion stopped playing, hugged the lute and touched it with his cheek. "This wood sings on its own! <span class="lute_emph">These strings are alive! What wonderful tonality!</span> Bloody hell, a couple of kicks and a bit of fear is a pretty low price to pay for such a superb lute. I'd have let myself be kicked from dawn to dusk if I'd known what I was going to get."
        </div>
        <div class="lute_2">
            Dandelion's soft, mournful singing and the music he raised from the lute's strings, <span class="lute_emph">murmuring like a stream flowing over pebbles</span> drifted to her from the chamber at the end of the corridor.
        </div>
        <div class="lute_3">
            "Songs and ballads" â€” the musician bowed - "never end, dear lady, because <span class="lute_emph">poetry is eternal and immortal,</span> it knows no beginning, it knows no end."
