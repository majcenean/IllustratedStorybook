        "You pig! You plague-stricken warbler! You trickster!"
        <br><br>
        A young, fair-haired woman in a nightdress was standing on a tiny balcony of a cottage (...) she hurled down a chipped flowerpot.
        <br><br>
        A slim man in a plum bonnet with a white feather jumped aside, and the flowerpot crashed onto the ground just in front of him, shattering to pieces.
        <br><br>
        "Please, Vespula!" The man in the bonnet shouted. "Don't lend credence to the gossip! I was faithful to you, may I perish if it is not true!"

    <div class="girls_2">
        "Hey Dandelion," called the Witcher, "How are you? What's going on?"
        <br><br><br>
        "Nothing special," said the troubadour, grinning.
        <br><br>
        <span class="girls_emph">"The usual."</span>
        <br><br>
        "Greetings, Geralt. What are you doing here? Bloody hell, look out!"

        A tin cup whistled through the air and bounced off the cobbles with a clang.
