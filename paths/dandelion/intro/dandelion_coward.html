<body class="dandelion_coward_bg">

    <div class="coward_1">
        Dandelion got up from his knees, rested his forehead against the wall, then vomited (...)
        <br><br>
        "What's going on? What happened? Are you in one piece?"
        <br><br>
        "Dandelion raised a hand, signalling that he would answer in a moment, because he didn't have time right then. And vomited again.
    </div>
    <div class="coward_2">
        "Thank you," the Witcher said. "Dandelion, say thank you. This is Maria Barring, or Milva. It's thanks to her we are alive."
        <br><br>
        Dandelion mumbled incoherently, bent over in a courly — but somewhat quavering — bow, then dropped to his knees and vomited.
    </div>
    <div class="coward_3">
        The witcher rushed to the poet, cowering on the sand.
        <br><br>
        "Dandelion? Are you dead? Dandelion, damn it! What's the matter with you?"
        <br><br>
        The poet jerked his head, shook his hands, and opened his mouth to scream. Geralt grimaced and narrowed his eyes — Dandelion had a trained — loud — tenor voice and, when frightened, could reach extraordinary registers.
    </div>
    <div class="coward_4">
        "Your friend has decided to faint. What shall we do?"
    </div>
    <div class="coward_5">
        "Dandelion, how are you? Everything in order? Can you stand?"
        <br><br>
        "I'm good, I'm good," gibbered Dandelion. "I'm feeling better. Much better..." 
        <br><br>
        "You don't look like someone who's feeling better."
        <br><br>
        "Damnit, I've barely escaped with my life!" said the poet, getting to his feet and holding onto a bureau. "For fuck's sake, I've never been so afraid (...) But when I saw you I knew you'd save me. I mean, I didn't, but I was counting strongly on it..."
    </div>
    <div class="coward_6">
        "Geralt!" Dandelion shouted. "Save me!"
    </div>
