<!--Introductory Quote-->
    <div class="intro_quote">
        <div class="dandelion_bg_1">
            A peal of laughter and the strumming of a lute resounded in the corridor and there, on the threshold of the library, stood Dandelion in a <span class="dandelion_bg_emphasis_1">lilac jerkin</span> with lace cuffs, his hat askew. <br><br>
            The troubadour bowed exaggeratedly, the heron feather pinned to his hat sweeping the floor.
        </div>
        <div class="dandelion_bg_2">
            As for Dandelion the dandy, he had already been mistaken a few times for an elf or half-elf, especially since he had <i>started wearing his hair to his shoulders and occasionally used curling irons.</i>
        <div class="dandelion_bg_5">
            The witcher stretched out comfortably on the straw. Dandelion, evidently afraid of getting his <span class="dandelion_bg_emphasis_5">elegant green jerkin</span> dirty, sat on the plank.
        </div>
        </div>
        <div class="dandelion_bg_3">
            An elegant fancy hat with the feather of an egret stuck into it, with his blonde hair coiffured by irons. Wearing a doublet, the colour of <span class="dandelion_bg_emphasis_2">red wine,</span> and a shirt with a lace frill. With his inseparable lute, and inseparable insolent smile on his lips.
        </div>
        <div class="dandelion_bg_4">
            Next to him there was a thin man, half dozing, delicately strumming chords on a lute. An eccentric <span class="dandelion_bg_emphasis_4">plum coloured hat</span> decorated with a silver buckle and a long egret feather drooped over his eyes. Geralt recognized the hat and the feather so famous and known in all the manors, castles, guesthouses, inns and brothels. <br><span class="dandelion_bg_emphasis_3">Especially in the brothels.</span>
