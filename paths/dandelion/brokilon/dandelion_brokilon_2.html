        The bard adjusted his hat to a jaunty angle over his left ear, prodded his horse with his heels and headed into the ravine, whistling a well-known and extremely indecent cavalry song.

        Dandelion quickened his pace in order to get away as quickly as possible. He didn’t want to sabotage the reputation he’d just earned himself.
        <br><br>

    <div class="brokilon_5b">
