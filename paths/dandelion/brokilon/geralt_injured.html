        A few weeks later, having been healed by the dryads of Brokilon, Geralt wondered what mistakes he had made during the fight. And came to the conclusion he hadn’t made any. His only mistake was made before the fight. He ought to have fled before it even began.
    </div>
    <div class="geralt_injured_2">
        Geralt could see nothing and hear nothing. (...) He felt cold. His entire body was cold, numb, and foreign.
        <br><br>
        “Hold on, Geralt.”
        <br><br>
        The pain returned. It bored into his guts and his temples, and it radiated all the way to his eyes, to his ears, to the top of his head.
        He was losing consciousness.

        Darkness. Bitter cold.
