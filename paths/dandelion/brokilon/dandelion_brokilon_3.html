        The poet sat down and rested the lute on his knee. He plucked the strings, once then twice, then a third time. He twisted the pegs, turned the lute and began to play. And a moment later, to sing.

    </div>
    <div class="brokilon_7">
        He didn’t hear — but he felt — somebody’s presence.
        <br><br>
        “Don’t shoot...” he whispered, obediently not looking around. “I come in peace...”
        <br><br>
        “<i>Sh’aente.</i>” [”Keep playing.”]
    </div>
    <div class="brokilon_8">
        He obeyed, although his fingers had turned cold and numb on the strings, and he had difficulty making any sound whatsoever emerge from his throat. (...) <br><br>But he was a professional, dammit.
    </div>
    <div class="brokilon_9">
        “I...” he began. “I am... The comrade of the witcher Geralt... I know that Geralt is among you in Brokilon. I have come...”
    </div>
