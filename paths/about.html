        The Witcher universe was created by Andrzej Sapkowski, a contemporary Polish fantasy author. <br><br>
        The text for this project was taken from the series over the 8 books in <i>The Witcher</i> series: <br><br>
        <ul>
            <li><i>The Last Wish</i> (trans. Danusia Stok),</li>
            <li><i>The Sword of Destiny</i> (trans. David French), </li>
            <li><i>Blood of Elves</i> (trans. Danusia Stok), </li>
            <li><i>Time of Contempt</i> (trans. David French), </li>
            <li><i>Baptism of Fire</i> (trans. David French), </li>
            <li><i>The Tower of the Swallow</i> (trans. David French), </li>
            <li><i>Lady of the Lake</i> (trans. David French), and </li>
            <li><i>Season of Storms</i> (trans. David French).</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        The saga addresses the witcher Geralt and others' reactions to the raising and later disappearance of a very special girl, Cirilla "Ciri" of Cintra, who is Geralt's daughter by bonds of destiny.<br><br>
        In seeking to rescue his daughter, Geralt finds himself accompanied by a group of comrades willing to share in his journey. Their resemblance of a traditional RPG team of heroes [with two swordsmen, a ranger, a healer, and a rogue] inspired this concept. <br><br>
        This project serves as a telling of their story reimagined in the medium of web design, an  interactive storybook woven from curated scenes and quotes from the series.
