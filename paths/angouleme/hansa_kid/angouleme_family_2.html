        "Come, come," Regis interjected placatingly. "Girls, take it easy. Milva, Angouleme, let there be concord. United we stand, divided we fall."

        "It's impossible for the tracks to have been left by a horse (...)"<br><br>
        "When I say a horse, I meant a horse!"<br><br>
        Milva, as usual, preferred practice to theory. She dismounted and bent over, pushing her hat back on her head.
        <br><br>
        <span class="fam_milva">"The pup's right,"</span> she decided after a moment.

        <br><br>
        "Spare the other words. Those charming ones will suffice."

        "Well, I never!" she said right after she'd been sat down in a chair and had her hands handcuffed behind the backrest. "Look what the cat's dragged in!"

        "Oho," Regis said placidly. <span class="fam_regis">"Look what the cat dragged in."</span>

        And I want to go with him, with Geralt, because <i>it's only when I'm with him I'm not afraid</i> that the coroner will catch me."
